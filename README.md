# VRV Security RBAC Dashboard

## Overview

I have successfully completed the **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard**, implementing key **User Management** and **Role Management** functionalities. In **User Management**, I included features like viewing users in a table, adding and editing user details dynamically, deleting users with confirmation, toggling user account statuses, and a search filter for efficiently finding users. The **Role Management** module allows for creating roles with custom permissions, editing role attributes and permissions, and deleting roles effectively.

This project was developed using **ReactJS**, leveraging concepts like React Router, `useState`, `useEffect`, props, and modular components, along with **Firestore Database** for real-time data management. A responsive design was achieved using normal CSS. The project is deployed on **Vercel** for live demonstration, with the source code hosted on GitHub. This submission highlights my expertise in building functional UIs, integrating Firestore for data storage, implementing search functionality, and adhering to best React development practices. The repository and deployment are well-documented for easy review.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kittu14216/RBAC.git
